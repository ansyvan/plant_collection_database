# plant_collection_database
(in progress...)

This is a database on my houseplant collection which counts more than 40 species of exotic plants. The project is supposed to contain a few tables on plant species names, specimens, their development stages, plant care routine records, vendors and the purchase prices.

The main `plants` table contains plant `species`, `genus`, `family` and `common name` columns. It is not about specimens, because every species could be represented in two or more specimens in my collection. That's why I plan to create `specimens` table as well. 

See the [script](https://github.com/ansyvan/plant_collection_database/blob/main/scripts/CREATE_plant_collection_Script.sql) of the `plants` table creation and a [grid view](https://github.com/ansyvan/plant_collection_database/blob/main/screenshots/plants_table_view.png).
